## Technologies

Being a Backend Developer, I will mostly focus myself on that side of the project (no worries, it won't be all black and white with a mainstream font üòâ). 
To do so, I will be using... 

ü•Å *drum roll* ü•Å

### Why? 

Because I can. 
And because I fell in love with these frameworks! I also want to become an expert in that field, so... here is that. 

## And after? 

I have started to think about migrating the whole GUI within Electron (yes, like the developers of Discord did. And so did many others, though), so the users can have both the web and desktop versions of the app. 

But first... let's get to work!

## Thought process

### Frontend

For the client side, I have been rethinking this project several times. 
I first wanted to use only Laravel and blade. Then, I wanted to use VueJS and learned the framework. Now, I am willing to get back to using blade, but I am wondering whether I'll be using **LiveWire** or **splade**. 
Once I'll have made my choice, I'll let you know here!
